This is the CS144 configuration test web application.

Copy the web application (.war file) to your Tomcat webapps directory, 
start the server, and browse to http://localhost:8080/cs144/p1. If your 
Java + Tomcat + MySQL setup is correct, you should see a simple page which 
contains information about your environment.
